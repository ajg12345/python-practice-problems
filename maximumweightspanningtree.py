"""
Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was asked by Microsoft.

Recall that the minimum spanning tree is the subset of edges of a tree 
that connect all its vertices with the smallest possible total edge weight. 
Given an undirected graph with weighted edges, compute the maximum weight spanning tree.

# seems like its possible to use Prim's algorightm or Kruskal's algorithm for this question
