This problem was asked by Microsoft. (Easy)

Print the nodes in a binary tree level-wise. For example, the following should print 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
  1
 / \
2   3
   / \
  4   5
"""

# a good answer here would be to enqueue the node values and then print that queue

#but before i can do this, I'll have to figure out a nice tree library and learn its methods for python
